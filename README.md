# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Purpose of analysis is to assist travelers who are looking into weather patterns for their destinations. Three analysis folders
have been created to also help travelers: weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.

## Weather Database

This uses Open Weather Map API for weather info on cities around the world. This provides the following:
- Max temp
- Cloudiness
- Wind Speed
- Humidity
- Type of Weather

## Vacation Search

This section uses info gained above and Google Maps API to mark destinations with weather info including Hotel name. Temp was set
between 75 and 95 degrees.

## Vacation Itinerary

This shows the info gathered from Google Maps Directions API to map out what the drive would potentially appear for traveling between
all the stops choosen. Note start and finish are the same city. In our case we have choosen: Avera(start/stop), Rincon, Russel, and Ocala.
